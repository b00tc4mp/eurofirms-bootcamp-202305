    <h1>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h1>

    <p>
        Server-side rendering (SSR) means that the content of your site is generated on the server, then sent to the
        browser. This is useful for SEO purposes, because search engines can "see" the content of your site before they
        send it to users.</p>

    <h2>What Is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?</h2>

    <p>Server-side rendering is where your site’s content is rendered on the web server rather than the browser. This
        server prepares an HTML file with user-specific data and sends it to the user’s machine.
        <br><br>
        The browser then interprets the content and displays the page, giving the user a fully rendered HTML page
        without waiting for JavaScript or CSS files to load.
        <br><br>
        Many think this method is favorable for SEO compared to client-side rendering, but let’s first see how SSR
        works.
    </p>

    <h2>The Server-Side Rendering Process</h2>

    <p>As we’ve discussed, server-side rendering enables website content to appear quickly by eliminating the need to
        download and run application code.
        <br><br>
        But how is your HTML rendered on the server in response to navigation?
        <br><br>
        - The user opens their browser and requests to open the webpage.<br>
        - The server creates rendered content in a viewable HTML file and sends it to the user. The CSS is also
        displayed<br>
        - on the browser, but the page is not yet interactive.<br>
        - Meanwhile, the browser downloads the JavaScript of the page, which is readily available on the server.<br>
        - The user can now interact with the site and the different elements.<br>
        - The browser implements the JavaScript (Document Object Model or DOM is fully rendered).<br>
        - The page is now fully loaded and can respond to the interactions of the user journey.<br>
        - Many popular JavaScript frameworks, including Angular and React, use server-side rendering.<br>
        <br>
        Social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter also use rendered content before it’s sent to the user.
