    <h1>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h1>

    <p>
        Server-side rendering (SSR) means that the content of your site is generated on the server, then sent to the
        browser. This is useful for SEO purposes, because search engines can "see" the content of your site before they
        send it to users.</p>
