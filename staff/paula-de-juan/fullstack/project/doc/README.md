## General description of the application

It is going to be a social network to find users with the same taste in music. Users are allowed to register and select the styles of music that they like and also select the bands of musicians that they like the most between the list that we suggest. After that process, our application will show the people registered with the same taste in music. You could see the users that had selected the same styles of music and also the bands and then is when you could see their pictures and you could choose with who you want to have a match and you can start to contact by phone or email with the people that you have selected as favourite to be your future friends.

## Functional Description

The application let the user register and do login on the website. After that the user will see the home-page empty at the first moment. The application invites the users to insert and complete their taste in music and after that is when the home-page refreshes and retrieve the list of users's profiles and then you can click in the profile of users to see the biography or description and the taste of music of that person. You will see the percentage of match that you have with every user in the styles, bands, musicians and in general, the taste of music. If you want to contact with another user you will find in the profile the phone number or the email to contact or maybe both. 
Some people could prefer not to put their phone numbers. But you could always try to contact by email. Enjoy and have fun!
